Egg sizes can vary within bird species species and within an individual based on the time of year, food availability, order in the laying period, and age. 
Subsequently, the hatching and fledging rates may be correlated with egg sizes depending on the species. 
Here I will be exploring the egg size (lengths and widths) of eggs from Pukekos (*Porphyrio melanotus melanotus*). 
Pukekos exhibit a very rare breeding behaviour known as joint-laying where more than 1 female may lay eggs in the same nest and collectively take care of the young.
Pukekos live in kin groups woth linear dominance hierachy systems.
Egg sizes and patterns vary between and within females laying in the nest but the females don't seem to show any preferences for their own eggs compared the others.
A fair bit is known about egg sizes in other bird species but I am curious how egg sizes might play a role in this rare breeding and social system. 

I have data on the egg dimensions, laying order, hatching success, and genetic relatedness to dominant and subordinate members of the group. 
The biological questions are currently being brainstormed but I am interested in seeing if there are any relationships or patterns between egg size and the 
rare breeding system that could provide some insight into the evolution of joint laying behaviour and dominance hierarchies. 

P.S. Please ask for any references.




I have added my assignment 2 and the readRDS scripts to my repository. 
The main assignment 2 script is pretty simple still as I get my project and available data sorted out. I looked at the structure and class of my 
data to see if there were any problems. I also made some histograms and a scatterplot to see how my data is spread. 
I added a saveRDS at the end of the script that saves my dataframe of my data. 
My second script can read in the rds file from the other script under a new name in a new session. This script is also very simple, just repeats the scatterplot
but I changed the colour of the points from black to blue and the theme of the figure. 
The working directory of my project is "/Users/justinbenjamin/Desktop/McMaster/Courses/BIO 708/QMEE"
I don't quite understand what the question "what working directory should they be run from?" mean and would like some clarification on that in class next week. 

I am going to meet with my supervisor soon to discuss the directions the project will go. I am currently trying to compile all the data we have from 
past years on egg size into a single spreadsheet with the same format to simplify analyses in R (a grueling process so far). 
In terms of breaking down the project into replicable components, here are some ideas to make sure my work is reproduceable:

1. Documenting my steps along the way like using this README or commenting in my code.
2. Version control using Git or RMarkdown. 
3. Trying to automate repetitive tasks where possible (have excel or R do math and organization so I don't have to). This could include data fetching, 
   preprocessing steps. This would enhance replicability and reduces human error.
